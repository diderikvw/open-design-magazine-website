# Open Design Magazine
Open Design Magazine (working title) is the world's first community-created magazine about Open Design and Open Source Hardware. The magazine informs and inspires both insiders and a broader audience with case studies, interviews and background information about initiatives and practical results of what is currently being accomplished in Open Design.

Content of the magazine is published under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International license, as far as possible.

Open Design Magazine is digitally provided for free (gratis), the physical version can be ordered to print locally for a fee (TBD).

# Creation process
The magazine is created in 5 phases:

##  1. Determine Feasability (stealth mode)
The goal of this phase is to determine:
- If 6 authors can be found, willing to commit to writing an article about their (or a) comtemporary Open Design project
- If a magazine can be created with very limited resources (time and money), using a collaborative process and Open Source tools

Intermediate results:
- 3 authors have indicated their willingness to contribute an article:
-- Christian Villium, about the REMODEL program of Danish Design Center
-- Jérémy Bonvoisin, about the OPEN! Research Project
-- Vincent Muller, about the Pioneer's House of WikiHouseNL
- Creative Commons and Open Knowledge Foundation have shown interest in the initiative
- A GitHub repository with GitBook Desktop and GitBook Web has been successfully set up, promising a collaborative asynchronous co-located way for collaborative writing, reviewing and version management

To do:
- A broader call for articles to find 3 additional authors

In this phase the project is in 'stealth mode', not giving broad attention to the initiative.
